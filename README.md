# Basement Buddy
Screen size: 1024x768 (iPad)

## Description:

A school project made for Business Academy Aarhus's student bar Basement. 
The goal was to attract more customers and digitalize the experience at the bar.
We came up with an idea to create an app that would run on tablets placed on tables in the bar for people to interact with
while hanging out after classes.<br>
It was planned, designed and developed entirely by our 4-person group.

The parts that I coded are:<br>
- Taboo Game<br>
- Menu page
